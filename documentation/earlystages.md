# Early stages

## throwing ideas

When we decided to collaborate on this project, we sat and discussed interesting
ideas for the project. Some of them were very technical, we had one idea, in  
which would create a computer in game of life and then write a programming language
for it, needless to say that was too complex for us. we also had another idea where
we write fluid similutor with actual physics, this idea was too complex for us too.
We eventually decided on making an evolution simulator.
